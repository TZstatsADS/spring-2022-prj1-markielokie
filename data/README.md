# ADS Project 1:  R Notebook on the history of philosophy

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

The dataset, *philosophy_data.csv*, is over 300MB and will not be uploaded to this repo. If you'd like a copy of the data, you may download it from the [Philosophy Data Project](http://philosophydata.com/index.html) or you may reach me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lokemarcus/).
